## About Me

I am a neurosurgery resident in TX, USA.

Inspired by the websites including: [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), [Sci-Hub](https://www.sci-hub.st/), [Radiopaedia](https://radiopaedia.org/), and [neuroangio](http://neuroangio.org/), etc., I aim to create a free website based on my [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) (PKM) tool - [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
